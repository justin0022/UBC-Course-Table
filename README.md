# UBC-Course-Table
Built on UBC's CMS, uses course-shortcode (https://github.com/ubc/course-shortcode) and parses the result to create a searchable table. 

Demo here: http://lfs-sbcollab.sites.olt.ubc.ca/courses/

The courses are gathered from the UBC Calendar, and will thus be always up to date. The course outline is generated by appending the course code to the UBC Wiki URL. I used the DataTable JQuery plugin to create the table and the search functionality. 

To use, just modify the list of shortcodes at the top of the UBC-Course-Table.html file. 

[ubccourses department="AANB" stickyyear="true" stickywinter="w"] <br>
[ubccourses department="APBI" stickyyear="true" stickywinter="w"] <br>
[ubccourses department="FNH" stickyyear="true" stickywinter="w"] <br>
[ubccourses department="FOOD" stickyyear="true" stickywinter="w"] <br>
[ubccourses department="FRE" stickyyear="true" stickywinter="w"] <br>
[ubccourses department="GRS" stickyyear="true" stickywinter="w"] <br>
[ubccourses department="HUNU" stickyyear="true" stickywinter="w"] <br>
[ubccourses department="LFS" stickyyear="true" stickywinter="w"] <br>
[ubccourses department="PLNT" stickyyear="true" stickywinter="w"] <br>
[ubccourses department="SOIL" stickyyear="true" stickywinter="w"] <br>

Swap out the department code with the correct course code (ie: "CPSC") and the table will build automatically.
