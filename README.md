# UBC-Course-Table
Built on UBC's CMS, uses course-shortcode (https://github.com/ubc/course-shortcode) and parses the result to create a searchable table. 

Demo here: http://lfs-sbcollab.sites.olt.ubc.ca/courses/

The courses are gathered from the UBC Calendar, and will thus be always up to date. The course outline is generated by appending the course code to the UBC Wiki URL. I used the DataTable JQuery plugin to create the table and the search functionality. 

To use, just modify the list of shortcodes between the <div class="invisible"> element to list different faculty courses. 
<div class="invisible">

[ubccourses department="APBI" stickyyear="true" stickywinter="w"]
